Remote login to your mac via VNC

Using this basic script you can remotely login to your OS X system using a VNC client (like Chicken of the VNC). This script goes on the idea that you're not at the location of the computer you wish to remotely connect to (like your work computer). 

Make sure you stop the service after use.
